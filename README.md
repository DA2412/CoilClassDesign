# CoilClassDesign
This is a class implementing useful functions for determining the magnetic field and self-inductance of a solenoid (coil) of finite dimension and with circular or non-circular cross section. In particular, the cross section can be defined as a superellipse allowing to model a variety of shapes.

An example notebook is present for the assessment of the impact of small geometrical variations of a real solenoid on the produced magnetic field.

An additional test file is presented.
